# eVTOL-VehicleModel ðŸš€

## Overview

The aerodynamic performance of a **multirotor eVTOL aircraft** is strongly influenced by the **complex interactions between rotors and wings**. Due to the **non-linear and unsteady nature of the flow**, traditional aerodynamic modeling approaches rely on **high-fidelity CFD simulations**, which are computationally expensive.

This repository presents a **data-driven surrogate aerodynamic model** based on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to predict the aerodynamic coefficients of aircraft components. Two distinct **graph-based architectures**â€”**Hierarchical** and **Recurrent**â€”are implemented to model the **rotor-rotor and rotor-wing interactions**. The proposed framework integrates deep learning techniques to **streamline the aerodynamic modeling process**, making it more computationally efficient for the **conceptual design phase**.

## Features

**Modular Aerodynamic Modeling** â€“ Airfoil, wing, and rotor models are trained separately.  
**Graph Neural Network (GNN)** â€“ Captures rotor-to-rotor and rotor-wing interactions.  
**Hierarchical vs. Recurrent Architectures** â€“ Two different graph-based learning strategies.  
**CFD-Based Training Data** â€“ Uses CFD simulation data from **FLOWUnsteady**.  
**Optimized Deep Learning Models** â€“ CNNs, LSTMs, and GNNs tailored for aerodynamic predictions.

- **Training Data:** **FLOWUnsteady** simulation results incorporating variations in **rotor speeds, angles of attack, and freestream velocity**.

### **3 Composite Model (eVTOL Aircraft)**
